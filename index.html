    <h3> All About Cotton Candy </h3>
    <p>   I am making a website in my computer systems information class. It will be about cotton candy and the flavors it consists of and the costs associated with each flavor. Here is a quick background about cotton candy from Wikipedia. Cotton candy is a spun sugar confection that resembles cotton. It usually contains small amounts of flavoring or food coloring.[1]

The candy is made by heating and liquefying sugar, spinning it centrifugally through minute holes—by which the sugar rapidly cools and re-solidifies into fine strands.[2] It is often sold at fairs, circuses, carnivals, and festivals—served in a plastic bag or on a stick or paper cone.[3][4][5]

Cotton candy is made and sold globally—as candy floss in the UK, Ireland, New Zealand, Egypt, India, Sri Lanka, and South Africa, and as fairy floss in Australia.</p>

  <h3> Cotton Candy History </h3>
<p> Several places claim the origin of cotton candy, with some sources tracing it to a form of spun sugar found in Europe in the 19th century. At that time, spun sugar was an expensive, labor-intensive endeavor and was not generally available to the average person.[7] Others suggest versions of spun sugar originated in Italy as early as the 15th century.[8]

Machine-spun cotton candy was invented in 1897 by dentist William Morrison and confectioner John C. Wharton, and first introduced to a wide audience at the 1904 World's Fair as "Fairy Floss"[9] with great success, selling 68,655 boxes at 25¢ (equivalent to $7.11 in 2019) per box[citation needed]. On September 6, 1905, Albert D. Robinson of Lynn, Massachusetts submitted his patent for an Electric Candy-Spinning Machine. The patent was for a combination of an electronic starter, motor-driven rotatable bowl, that maintained heating efficiently. By May 1907 he transferred the rights to the General Electric Company of New York. His patent still remains today as the basic Cotton Candy machine.[10]

Joseph Lascaux, a dentist from New Orleans, Louisiana, invented a similar cotton candy machine in 1921. In fact, the Lascaux patent named the sweet confection "cotton candy" and the "fairy floss" name faded away, although it retains this name in Australia.[11][12] In the 1970s, an automatic cotton candy machine was created which made the product and packaged it. This made it easier to produce and available to sell at carnivals, fairs, and stores in the 1970s and on.

Tootsie Roll Industries, the world's largest cotton-candy manufacturer, makes a bagged, fruit-flavored version called Fluffy Stuff.[13]

  In the United States, National Cotton Candy Day is celebrated on December 7.</p>
  <h3> Cotton Candy Flavoring </h3>
  <p>The source material for candy mesh is usually both colored and flavored. When spun, cotton candy is white because it is made from sugar, but adding dye or coloring transforms the color. Originally, cotton candy was just white. In the US, cotton candy is available in a wide variety of flavors, but two flavor-blend colors predominate—blue raspberry and pink vanilla,[17] both originally formulated by the Gold Medal brand (which uses the names "Boo Blue" and "Silly Nilly"). Cotton candy may come out purple when mixed. Cotton candy machines were notoriously unreliable until Gold Medal's invention of a sprung base in 1949—since then, they have manufactured nearly all commercial cotton candy machines and much of the cotton candy in the US.[18]

Typically, once spun, cotton candy is only marketed by color. Absent a clear name other than "blue", the distinctive taste of the blue raspberry flavor mix has gone on to become a compound flavor that some other foods (gum, ice cream, rock candy, fluoride toothpaste) occasionally borrow ("cotton-candy flavored ice cream") to invoke the nostalgia of cotton candy. Pink bubble gum went through a similar transition from specific branded product to a generic flavor that transcended the original confection, and "bubble gum flavor" often shows up in the same product categories as "cotton candy flavor" </p>
